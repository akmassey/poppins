## Roadmap

Poppins is intended to be similar to [formd][2], but with easier
integration with Ruby projects.  Also, I would like to add the ability
to insert reference links they way Dr. Drang describes
[here](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2012/08/markdown-reference-links-in-bbedit/)
and [here][3].

It would also be really awesome if we could re-flow paragraph text and
wrap it at user-specified column lengths.
